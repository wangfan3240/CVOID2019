"注：按照统计制度要求，我国CPI每五年进行一次基期轮换，2016年1月开始使用2015年作为新一轮的对比基期，前三轮基期分别为2000年、2005年和2010年。CPI基期轮换是一项国际惯例，目的是使CPI调查所涉及到的商品和服务更具有代表性，更及时准确反映居民消费结构的新变化和物价的实际变动。
参考联合国制定的《按目的划分的个人消费分类》（COICOP）和国家统计局发布的《居民消费支出分类（2013）》，我们对CPI调查目录进行了调整，新基期调查目录和规格品与国际标准更为接近，一些新产品新服务纳入其中，能进一步反映居民消费和经济结构的变化。与上一轮基期相比，本轮基期的CPI调查目录有几个主要变化。一是按照《居民消费支出分类（2013）》，原来的“食品”、“烟酒”合并为现在的“食品烟酒”；原来的“医疗保健和个人用品”被拆分到现在的“生活用品及服务”、“医疗保健”和“其他用品和服务”中；原来的“娱乐教育文化用品及服务”被拆分到现在的“教育文化和娱乐”和“其他用品和服务”中；原来的“家庭设备用品及维修服务”被拆分到现在的“生活用品及服务”和“其他用品及服务”中。二是食品的指标内涵发生了变化，旧分类中的“食品”为大类，包括粮食、肉禽、鲜菜、鲜果、水产品、茶及饮料、在外餐饮等分类；新“食品”为“食品烟酒”大类下的中类，仅包括粮食、畜肉、禽肉、鲜菜、鲜果、水产品等，不再包括“茶及饮料”和“在外餐饮”两项。三是新增了“园艺花卉及用品”、“宠物及用品”、“养老服务”和“金融服务”等居民支出增加较快的分类，能够更加及时准确反映居民消费结构的新变化。"
